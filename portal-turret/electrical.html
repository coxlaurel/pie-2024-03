					<h2>Circuit Diagram</h2>
					<img src="images/circuit_diagram.png" alt="Circuit Diagram" class="responsive-image">
					<p>The circuit contains the following components: an accelerometer/magnetometer, an IR receiver, a sound sensing module, 
					a PCF8591 ADC/DAC module, a 9V DC motor, a L293D motor driver, two 9g SG90 servos, and a button. Additionally, a speaker 
					is connected to the Raspberry Pi via Bluetooth so audio can be played, and an IR remote control can be used to send IR 
					codes to the IR receiver.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Accelerometer</h3>
					<p> The accelerometer/magnetometer used is the LSM303AGR 3-axis accelerometer and 3-axis magnetometer. This measures the 
					acceleration forces and magnetic field strength in three dimensions. In this case, it is only being used to measure the 
					acceleration of the Portal Turret so it can detect when is picked up or moved around.
					<br>
					The LSM303AGR is connected to a 3.3V source, ground, SDA1 I2C, and SCL2 I2C.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>IR Receiver</h3>
					<p> The IR receiver can receive signals from an IR remote control. When buttons are pressed on the remote, an IR code is 
					transmitted, which the IR receiver reads and sends to the Raspberry Pi. From there, the code is processed to trigger some sort 
					of output response.
					<br>
					The IR receiver is connected to a 3.3V power source, ground, and GPIO17.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Sound Sensing</h3>
					<p>To read the intensity of nearby sounds, two components are necessary: the sound sensing module and the PCF8951 ADC/DAC Module. 
					The sound sensing module outputs analog values, with a lower number corresponding to a louder noise. However, the Raspberry Pi 4 
					Model B does not built-in analog capabilities, making it unable to directly read the values outpuuted by the sound sensor. The 
					PCF8951 ADC/DAC helps address this limitation, as it converts the analog signal the sound sensor outputs into a digital one that 
					the Raspberry Pi can read. Both of these components come from Sunfounder.
					<br>
					The sound sensor is connected to a 3.3V source, ground, and the PCF8591 ADC/DAC while the PCF8591 is connected to 
					the sound sensor, a 3.3V source, ground, SDA1 I2C, and SCL1 I2C. The `SIG` pin of the sound sensor is fed into the `AIN3` pin of 
					the PCF8591 ADC/DAC.</p>
					<br>
					<h3>DC Motors</h3>
					<p>To move the motors, two components are necessary: the 9V DC motor and the L293D Motor Driver. The Raspberry Pi 4 Model B can only 
					supply a limited amount of current (16-20 mA per pin) and voltage (5V), which would not be able to successfully the power the 9V DC 
					Motors. Attempting to power the motors via the Raspberry Pi could cause damage to it. The L293D motor drive helps address these limitations. 
					It handles higher currents (around 600 mA per channel), allows for bidirectional movement of the motors, tolerates higher voltage (up to 36V), 
					provides protection features that safeguard the Raspberry Pi from voltage spikes, and supports up to two motors concurrently. The L293D 
					requires an external voltage sources, so a 9V battery was connected to it. When connected to the Raspberry Pi through the GPIO pins, the 
					user can send signals to the driver to control the motor's speed and direction. The L293D motor driver also features PWM control, allowing 
					for speed control of the motors.
					<br>
					The L293D has 16 different pins, with 8 pins dedicated to powering and control each motor. Pins 1 and 2 are the enable pins for controlling 
					the operation of the two motor channels; pins 2, 7, 10, and 15 are the input pins that control the rotation direction of the motor; pins 3, 6, 
					11, and 14 are the output pins connected to the motors; pins 4, 5, 12, and 13 are the ground pins; and pins 8 and 16 are the pins connected 
					to the voltage source. In this case, pin 1 is connected to GPIO25, pin 2 is connected to GPIO24, pin 3 is connected to the ground terminal of 
					the 9V DC motor, pins 4 and 12 are connected to ground terminal of the 9V battery, pin 6 is connected to the positive power supply of the 9V 
					DC motor, pin 7 is connected to GPIO23, and pins 8 and 16 are connected to the positive power supply of the 9V battery.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Servos</h3>
					<p>The two servos used in the circuit are TowerPro 9g SG90 Servos. These servos are controlled with PWM signals, which determine the angle of 
					rotation. These servos are attached to the ends of the rack in the rack-and-pinion system and are responsible for moving the wings forward and 
					backwards
					<br>
					The servos are each connected to a 5V source and ground. The left servo is connected to GPIO18 whereas the right serov is connected to GPIO16.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Button</h3>
					<p>The button is primarily used for testing and troubleshooting purposes when the IR remote control is not being used. When the button is pressed, 
					it closes the internal switch, allowing power to flow to the connected pin. This action pulls the pin's state to `HIGH,` which can be detected by the 
					Raspberry Pi. To do this, a pull-down resistor is used, as the pin is designed to detect changes from its default state of `LOW` to `HIGH`. With this 
					in mind, a resistor value of 1kΩ was chosen.
					<br>
					The button is connected to a 3.3V source and GPIO4. There is a 1kΩ resistor between the voltage source and the button.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Other Components</h3>
					<p>The components listed above are all directly connected to the circuit, but there are some other components that need to be mentioned. There 
					is a speaker connected to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B via Bluetooth, which allows for audio to be played as an output. There is also an IR remote 
					control as mentioned before, which can send codes to the IR receiver to trigger some sort of output.</p>
