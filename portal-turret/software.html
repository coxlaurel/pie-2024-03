					<h2>Concept</h2>
					<p>Our ideas included moving the motors and play audio depending on the values the various 
					sensors read and which mode the Portal Turret was on. To do this, we had to initialize the 
					firmware, create functions to read each sensor's output, and write software that would trigger 
					some kind of output depending on what signals were given.</p>

					<h2>Firmware</h2>
					<p>The firmware is designed to manage the various components in the circuit. 
					These components will be connected to various pins on the Raspberry Pi 4, 
					which acts as a central processing unit for the whole system.</p>

					<h3>System Initialization</h3>
					<p>Upon startup, the firmware will initialize different components, setting up
					the necessary GPIO pins, I2C communication, and Bluetooth connections. The GPIO set 
					up configures the GPIO pins for the input and output system components.
					The GPIO inputs include the sensors (accelerometer, sound sensing module, camera, IR 
					receiver, and button) and the GPIO ouputs include motors (DC and servo motors) and LEDs.
					The I2C set up intializes the I2C bus for communication with the PCF8591 ADC/DAC and 
					the LSM303AGR accelerometer/magnetometer. The Bluetooth set up establishes a connection 
					with the Bluetooth speaker, allowing audio to be played as an output.</p>

					<h3>Accelerometer/Magnetometer (LSM303AGR)</h3>
					<p>The firmware reads acceleration data from LSM303AGR to monitor the movement of the 
					Portal Turret. It uses I2C to read acceleration and magnetic field data. In this case, it 
					can detect when the Portal Turret is picked up or moved. If movement is detected, certain 
					actions, such as motor movement or audio output, are performed. To get the acceleration 
					data, functions in `acceleration.py` are called. It uses the `board`, `busio`, 
					`adafruit_lis2mdl`, and `adafruit_lsm303_accel` libraries to work.</p>

					<h3>IR Receiver</h3>
					<p>The IR receiver listens for signals from the IR remote control. It is connected to 
					GPIO17, which can be modified in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`. Each button on the IR remote 
					control is mapped to an IR code via the `lircd.conf`, located in `/etc/lirc/lircd.conf`. 
					To receive IR codes, the `lirc` library is used. The functions to receive the signals are 
					located in `ir_receiver.py`.</p>

					<h3>Sound Sensing Module</h3>
					<p>The sound sensing module includes the sound sensor itself and a PCF8591 ADC/DAC. Ambient 
					sound levels will be read by the sound sensor and then sent to the PCF8591 ADC/DAC, which 
					wil then convert the analog output into a digital value. The sound sensing module is connected 
					to the PCF8591 ADC/DAC, which is connected to SDA1 I2C and SCL1 I2C. Execeeding a certain 
					sound level will trigger an output action, such as playing sound or moving the motors. The 
					`sound_sensing.py` file contains functions to read the sound level. To work, it uses the 
					`adafruit_pcf8591`, `board`, `busio`, and `RPi.GPIO` libraries.</p>
					
					<h3>DC Motor Control</h3>
					<p>The firmware controls the 9V Motor motor through the L293D motor driver using PWM. PWM 
					signals are sent from the Raspberry Pi to the L293D motor driver to control the speed and 
					direction of the motor. The motors are controlled via functions contained in 
					`move_wings.py`, which uses the `RPi.GPIO` library. The motor is connected to GPIO23, 24, 
					and 25, with GPIO23 and 24 telling the motor which direction to spin and GPIO25 controlling 
					whether the motor is on or not.</p>

					<h3>Servo Control</h3>
					<p>The firmware manages two SG90 servos which rotate the wings of the Portal Turret. PWM 
					are generated to control the angle of rotation of each servo. The firmware defines the 
					pulse width corresponding to the desired angle. The right servo is connected to GPIO16, 
					and the left servo is connected to GPIO18. The file `move_servos.py` contain the 
					functions used to move the servos. It uses the `RPi.GPIO` library.</p>

					<h3>Button Input Handling</h3>
					<p>The button is a manual input method primarily used for testing and troubleshooting. It
					is connected to GPIO4. The pin detects state changes from `HIGH` to `LOW` when pressed. </p>

					<h3>Main Loop and Event Handling</h3>
					<p>The firmware operates within a main loop that continously checks the state of various 
					components and responds to events. The main loop includes polling the IR receiver for 
					incoming codes and reading sensor values. It also handles events by executing corresponding 
					actions, such as moving the motors or servos or playing audio. The main loop also tracks the 
					mode the Portal Turret is in, which dictates which sensor inputs are read and what outputs 
					can be given. This main loop is contained in `main.py`.</p>

					<h2>Software</h2>
					<p>The software is designed to take the various inputs to determine the state of the Portal 
					Turret. Listed below are the various Python files used and a short description of what they do.</p>

					<h3>`acceleration.py`</h3>
					This file contains functions that read the acceleration and magnetism via the LSM303AGR. There 
					is also a function that dictates the type of output depending on the values read. There are 
					various libraries used, including `board`, `busio`, `adafruit_lis2mdl`, `adafruit_lsm303_accel`, 
					and `time`.
					<br>
					<b>get_acceleration()</b>: Gets the acceleration and magnetism read by the gyroscope.
					<br>
					<b>sounds_acceleratio()</b>: Determines if the acceleration is below a certain threshold. 
					In this case, it is detecting whether the Portal Turret is picked up. If it is and playing 
					a sound is not on cooldown, audio is played.
					<br><br>

					<h3>`ir_receiver.py`</h3>
					This file contains functions that set up the IR remote control and allow signals sent to be 
					read by the Raspberry Pi. Note that this requires LIRC to be set up on the Raspberry Pi before 
					use, which includes installing `LIRC` and setting up the appropriate configs. It uses the 
					`lirc` library.
					<br>
					<b>initialize_ir()</b>: Initializes the IR remote control.
					<br>
					<b>read_ir()</b>: Reads signals from the IR client.
					<br><br>

					<h3>`main.py`</h3>
					This file contains the main loop that will check the states of various components and respond to 
					events. While running, it will set the Portal Turret to a specific mode depending on which button 
					on the IR remote control is pressed. Depending on the mode, different buttons will elicit different 
					outputs. There are four main modes: stimulus detection, play music while dancing, play music 
					without dancing, and manual mode. There are various libraries used, including `os`, `sys`, `time`, 
					`threading`, `RPi.GPIO`, and `queue`. Classes and functions from other files are imported as well, 
					including `PlaySounds` from `play_sounds.py`, `PlayMusic` from `play_music.py`, `initialize_ir()` 
					and `read_ir()` from `ir_receiver.py`, `sounds_acceleration()` from `sound_sensing.py`, 
					`move_motors()` from `move_wings.py`, and `servo_backward()` and `servo_forward()` from `move_servos.py`.
					<br>

					received.
					<br><br>
					
					<h3>`move_servos.py`</h3>
					This file controls servo movement using PWM. TThe libraries used are `RPi.GPIO` and `time`.
					<br>
					<b>servo_forward()</b>: Moves the servo forward 45 degrees, waits for a specified time, and then 
					moves back to its original position.
					<br>
					<b>servo_backward()</b>: Moves the servo backward 45 degrees, waits for a specified time, and then 
					moves back to its original position.
					<br><br>

					<h3>`move_wings.py`</h3>
					This file includes a function that controls motor movement using the L293D motor driver. It uses 
					the libraries `RPi.GPIO` and `time`.
					<br>

					<br><br>

					<h3>`play_music.py`</h3>
					This file contains the class `PlayMusic`, which is an object to play music similarly to how an MP3 
					player would work. The class stores music files and plays them when commanded, even allowing the 
					Portal Turret to dance with the music. This class contains many functions, including 
					`get_music_files()`, `dance_to_song()`, `cycle_songs_button()`, `get_song_length()`, and 
					`ir_play()`. There are various libraries used, including `os`, `glob`, `RPi.GPIO`, `time`, 
					`audioplayer`, `threading`, and `mutagen`. It also imports functions from other files, such as 
					`read_sound()` from `sound_sensing.py` and `read_ir()` from `ir_receiver.py`.
					<br>
					<b>PlayMusic</b>: A class to play music on the Raspberry Pi. To work, it needs to have a `music` 
					folder which contains `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.ogg` files.
					<br><br>

					<h3>`play_sounds.py`</h3>
					This file contains the class `PlaySounds`, which is an object to play sounds. The class stores 
					sound files and folders and plays them when commanded, even allowing motor movement alongside the 
					audio output. This class contains many functions, including `directory_folders()`, `play()`, 
					`play_sound()`, and `play_on_press()`. There are various libraries used, including `random`, 
					`os`, `sys`, `glob`, `RPi.GPIO`, and `playsound`. Additionally, it imports `move_motors` from 
					`move_wings.py`.
					<br>
					<b>PlaySounds</b>: A class to play sounds on the Raspberry Pi. To work, it needs to have a `sounds` 
					folder, which contains subfolders that contain the sound files. The subfolders should be made 
					according to sound category (e.g. sounds that play when turned on, turned off, etc.). 
					<br><br>

					<h3>`sound_sensing.py`</h3>
					This file contains functions to detect sound and respond accordingly. There are various libraries 
					used, including `adafruit_pcf8591.pcf8591`, `board`, `busio`, `RPi.GPIO`, and `time`. Additionally, 
					the function `move_motors()` is imported from `move_wings.py`.
					<br>
					<b>sense_sound()</b>: Set up the sound sensing module, which includes the sound sensor and ADC.
					<br>
					<b>read_sound()</b>: Reads the sound values from the sensor. Depending on the threshold vaue and 
					the flags used, different actions will be performed (e.g. triggering motor movement or audio to 
					be played).
