For this project, she worked closely with Solidworks, laser cutters, and 3D printers. She prototyped various design ideas related to the marble basin structure and screw design and worked hard to create a functioning product. She worked on integrating the parts of her other members into the basin so that the product could run in a complete cycle. Further, she collaborated closely with her mechanical design team to get input on her design choices and give advice on her team’s choices.
