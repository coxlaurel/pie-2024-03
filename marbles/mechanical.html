                        The mechanical system has five main sections: the bin, the lift, the pathway, the sorters, and the frame. The marble starts in the bin where it rolls down an angle and is then pushed into a screw. This screw, powered by a motor, drives the marbles out of the bin and up a tube. After being pushed through the tube, the marble reaches the pathway. In the pathway, the marble undergoes color sensing and is pushed over a ledge by the solenoid and into the sorters. The sorters direct the marble either into the marble frame where the image is created, or into the trash chute to go back into the bin. Once an image is complete, a slide will be pulled from underneath the marble frame and will drop all marbles back into the bin.

                        For the mechanical design, two main considerations were kept in mind: designing for variability and designing for the user/a polished product. As learned early on, all of the marbles were slightly different sizes, so we kept that in mind when choosing, designing, and fabricating parts.  More importantly, however, we designed for an aesthetic appeal to the user. A large amount of material selection was based on user choice and viewing in mind.

                        The bin contains all of the marbles that will eventually be transported up into the lift. The bin has three acrylic walls, one MDF wall, and one MDF bottom. These walls had finger joints and T-nut joints so that they could be assembled. We decided to use finger joints to make the box extra durable and fail-safe if the t-nut joints didn’t work. T-nuts allowed the box to maintain a clean, sleek appearance while also allowing the acrylic and MDF parts to be connected securely into place. The strength of the M2s on either side of the box allowed for the basin to be very durable.  On the outside, the bin has a motor mounted onto an acrylic wall. 
                        Further, this box has a tube attached to the wall opposite the motor. This tube is bolted onto the box and is placed in front of the screw. This is so that marbles can be transported directly into the hole (on the box) that has been made to fit the diameter of the tube. This motor is used to make the screw turn so that marbles can be transported into the tube and out of the box. Inside the box, there is a screw, a top screw guard, and a bottom screw guard. The purpose of the screw guard is to make sure that the marbles stay aligned as they exit the basin and so that the marbles don’t get jammed when too many marbles are inside the basin. This piece is bolted onto the box and bottom screw guard. 
                        The bottom screw guard was created to make sure the marbles slide down towards the screw as they enter the basin, and it also helped with aligning the marbles to the screw. This guard was bolted onto the box to stay in place. The bin also has supports on the two sides of its walls. These supports allow the bin to be integrated with the frame.

                        The lift is driven by the screw and was designed with simplicity and aesthetics in mind. To limit marble jamming, the tube was designed with as few curves as possible and wide curve angles (no less than ninety degrees). Due to the unique angles and shapes required for the bottom tube attached to the bin and the top tube interfacing with the solenoid, the two tubes were printed. The middle tube was selected as a clear plastic tube to allow the viewer/user to see the “behind-the-scenes” aspect of our art maker and enhance its color and creativity. To affix the clear tube to the other printed tubes semicircle clamps were designed with adjustable tightness.

                        The pathway was designed with color sensor optimization in mind. The entire chamber is black and features a front plate that extends down into the sorting mechanism and up to the tube. The plate and marble chamber color increase the darkness and allows for better color sensing. The plate was attached to the chamber by threading 4/40 bolts into holes that were printed slightly smaller than 4/40 size to allow for ease of tolerance. Further, better color sensing was achieved through an inlay in the back that allows the sensor to be screwed down closer to the marble. Pathway length ensures that the solenoid does not need high power to push the marble over as the distance the marble needs to travel is less than one marble length past where it sits when color is sensed.                    </p>

                        For this project, we needed to direct marbles from a single pathway, where their color was sensed, into nine columns: eight for the image and one for the trash chute to send unusable marbles back to the basin. We iterated on our original design by using three turing dials to change the marble’s path based on its color and the image we were creating. Once the marble color was sensed, each dial would adjust to the appropriate angel, guiding the marble along the correct path. This was possible since each dial was directly driven by a servo for high angular accuracy. The system worked efficiently, as the marble dropped into the correct slot due to gravity after the solenoid moved it into the sorter. The entire design was three separate 3D printed PLA+ parts sandwiched together between cut MDF board for rigidity and clear acrylic for marble viewing. Everything was then held together by 6/32 bolts. The design was effective, scalable, and easy to maintain for an 8x8 grid and met the project's needs and functioned well.

                        Our marble frame was one of the most crucial components of the project. Its primary goal was to create a coherent image by using marbles, which required it to be strong enough to withstand marble impacts but subtle enough not to interfere with the pixelated illusion. To achieve this, we designed the frame with semi-circular grooves, allowing for precise spacing of 1/32 inch between marbles while providing enough support to absorb impacts. Each column was tailored to fit the optimal marble size of 0.5875 inches, based on our testing, and the frame accommodated eight columns, each holding eight marbles, for a total of 64 marbles; it was intentionally designed with quarter-inch walls to distinguish it from the rest. The marble frame slides beneath the marble sorter and is secured between MDF boards for rigidity and acrylic for visibility, all held together by 6/32 bolts. At the bottom of the frame is a 3D-printed component that holds an acrylic bar, which, when pulled, allows the marbles to drop easily into the basin and clear the frame for the next image. The design proved successful, scalable, and helped create coherent images using the marbles.
