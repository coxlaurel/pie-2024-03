                        All of our mechanical goals were achieved during this sprint.
                        The final basin was modeled in CAD using fasteners to see if we could obtain a clean finish. We asked the shop if our plan for putting the bin together with M2s made sense, and they agreed. We went along with laser cutting out MDF and acrylic material to obtain our box parts, and we assembled the box with M2 bolts, hex nuts, and washers. We worked closely to ensure marbles would slide toward and into the screw mechanism by designing better components that would allow that to happen.

                            The goal of sprint 3 for electrical was to make sure that the system was working consistantly and to finalize how we would power the system.

                        A lot of sprint 3 was spent trying to figure out how to power our system off of wall voltage. We needed 16v, 5v, and 3v at the same time for the solenoid, servos + sensor, and motor respectively. This became a huge headache and we decided to power the whole system using 16v from a power supply and use voltage step downs to create 5v and 3v channels. We also spent time rewirig component connections on a proto board to make sure less components could accidentally become unplugged

                            The software goal was to make the marble machine more interactive by letting users choose the pixel art the marble machine created.

                        We reached this goal by creating two ways for users to input images: uploading a picture to compress into 8x8 pixels, and drawing an 8x8 pixel image. We created a Python script that turned a picture into a compressed image for the marble machine to create with its eight-by-eight pixels and the six marble colors. This script communicated using serial with the Arduino program to create the chosen image. We also made a graphical user interface in Processing for users to draw an 8x8 pixel image to be made by the marble machine. Due to time constraints, this program didn’t directly communicate with the Arduino program, instead, it required the user to copy and paste code of their drawing from the Processing serial monitor into the Arduino program. 
Beyond this goal, we also updated the Arduino program so that the marble lift mechanism would be synced with the rest of the system. Specifically, the lift only turns on when the color sensor doesn’t see a marble so that the marble pathway doesn’t get jammed from having too many marbles. Additionally, we ordered more marbles so the machine could draw images that were mostly one color, but decided not to use these marbles because they had more variation (in size and color), causing the color sensing
