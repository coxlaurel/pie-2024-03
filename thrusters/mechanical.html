                <p> The mechanical system of our project consists of a mechanical design segment, and a fluids segment.
                    The mechanical design segment of the drone contains a compact 3D printed “brain”, which contains
                    attachment points for all the electrical components, and 4 carbon fiber tubes, which act as the
                    moment arms for thrust stabilization. The fluids segment of the drone consists of 2 two-liter bottle
                    pressure vessels and 4 air-propelling nozzles, integrated with PTFE tubing.

                </p>
                <p> Because aesthetic appeal was an important requirement for our project, the “brain” and nozzles were
                    designed to seamlessly integrate the mechanical design and fluids segments. Gas flow out of the air
                    tanks is passed through the carbon fiber tubes via internal tubing, and is ultimately expelled
                    through the 2mm nozzle orifice, all of which are held to the carbon fiber tubes with friction
                    screws. Importantly, the tanks are pressurized to 60 psi, but the drone system is run at 40 psi to
                    ensure a more accurate control loop and air conservation. As we were not able to include an onboard
                    regulator to regulate 40 psi in time, we ended up running the drone directly from the air
                    compressor. We've included a graph of tank pressure vs. time below to show our realistic airtime for
                    the final unregulated system.


                </p>
                <h2>Mechanical Milestones</h2>
                <p>
                    Initially, our mechanical system served as a testbed for electrical and software. To achieve this,
                    we designed
                    a simple seesaw mechanism, while simultaneously iterating on possible 4 thruster designs for the
                    future.

                <p>
                    Our final mechanical system consists of only a few designed parts, shown below. The left CAD image
                    shows
                    the "brain" of our drone, while the right CAD image shows the final nozzle design.

                <p>
                    If we were to continue this project, an important improvement, as mentioned above, would be to
                    include
                    onboard pressure regulation. To demonstrate why, we've included a graph of tank pressure vs. time
                    below
                    to show our realistic airtime for the final unregulated system. Note the exponential decay of
                    pressure!

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                    A key mechanical challenge we encountered was leakage throughout the fluid system. For
                    example, initial iterations of the pressure vessels were not able to hold pressure for an
                    extended amount of time, despite standard anti-leak protocols (sealing o-rings, teflon
                    around the disconnects). A reliable solution to this problem was found through more accurate
                    connections between the 3D printed bottle cap and disconnects. Specifically, ¼” NPT threads
                    were modeled directly on the bottle cap, rather than tapped, which resulted in less internal
                    damage to the bottle cap and a more robust, leak-free system.

                </p>
