# Defuse the Situation
## PIE 2024
### Joshua Espinoza, Alex Mineeva, Daniel Theunissen, Charlie Mawn

## Abstract
Defuse the Situation is a collaborative, interactive, and engaging bomb-defusal game based on the video game [Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](https://keeptalkinggame.com/). Our goal for this game was to implement a fully integrated, physical rendition of the video game.

### Objectives
We had a few goals in mind guiding us through the design of this game:
- Stay true to the source material, and implement a physical rendition of the video game.
- Maintain replayability, so that the same person can play the game multiple times without having the same experience.
- Create a physical model that seamlessly integrated electrical and mechanical components, while still being aesthetically pleasing.
- Keep the whole game contained to the suitcase, making it fully transportable.
- Keep accessibility in mind when designing, specifically for color-blind people.
